Starting Rules:

2 rooms

Room two presses button, resets room 1’s timer.

Room one presses button, resets room 2’s timer.

If room 1’s timer is up, room 1 wins.

If room 2’s timer is up, room 2 wins.

If both rooms button presses have accumulated 10 button presses, a 5 minute timer starts.

If a room’s timer has not finished before the 5 minute timer finished, the room with the least button presses wins.

# scenario 1
room 1 presses the button

when the timer runs out, room 1 will win


# scenario 2
room 1 presses the button

room 2 presses the button before the timer runs out

when the timer runs out, room 2 will win

# scenario 3
after room 2 has pressed the button and has incremented the total counter of presses to 100

then a general timer will decide whoever pressed the button the least amount of times wins
